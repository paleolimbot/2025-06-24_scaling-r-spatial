# Scaling the r-spatial ecosystem for the modern composable data pipeline

> R has long been a top choice for spatial statistics, building on the pioneering sp and spdep packages and the wide ecosystem surrounding them. With the introduction of the sf package, R became home to a first-class spatial data frame API. A growing number of R users; however, need to scale beyond the capabilities of sf. This webinar will three broad categories of techniques to scale spatial workflows in R, including   (1) ensuring that sf code is appropriately using features targeted at larger analyses, (2) using libraries that provide lower-level access to the primitives on which sf builds, including s2, wk, and geos, and (3) using database connectors and in-memory databases to write spatial SQL and perform computations in engines like PostGIS, DuckDB, and Apache Sedona. Finally, this webinar will provide an overview of the technologies that underlie these techniques, including GeoArrow, GeoParquet, and Apache Iceberg.
